# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description
This project was a warm up and prework packet for the Fullstack Web Developer Bootcamp to prepare students with the essential tools required to start the class.  A lot of this content I had already known but it was very helpful to have more practice and explanation using git and github.  I was able to set my local and work computers up to share my Github repo which is very helpful.
